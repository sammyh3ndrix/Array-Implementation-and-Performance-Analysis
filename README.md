Project Title: Variable-Sized Array Implementation and Algorithm Performance Analysis

Description: Implemented a variable-sized array option in C++ to enhance the selection sort algorithm's performance analysis. 
Modified existing code to prompt user input for array size, seed number, and range of numbers. 
Achievements:

Developed code to handle various array sizes, from small to large, measuring algorithm sort performance.
Utilized a random number generator with a specified seed number for reproducibility.
Sorted and output up to 200 numbers from the generated array, ensuring correct sorting and handling of duplicates.
Conducted performance analysis by graphing data points in Excel, showing the relationship between array size and sorting time.
Presented results in a Microsoft Word document and an Excel spreadsheet, demonstrating understanding of Big O notation and algorithm performance.
Responsibilities:

Enhancing the selection sort algorithm from a previous assignment to handle variable-sized arrays.
Integrating user input functionality for array size, seed number, and number range.
Ensuring compatibility with an online C++ compiler for testing and grading purposes.
Creating a graph in Excel to visualize algorithm performance and explain the results in terms of Big O notation.
